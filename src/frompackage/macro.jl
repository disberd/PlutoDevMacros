	@frompackage target import_block

The macro is basically taking a local Package (derived from `target`), loading
it as a submodule of the current Pluto workspace and then process the various
import/using statements inside `import_block` to extract varables/functions from
the local Package into the notebook.

When changes to the code of the local Package are made, the cell containing the
call to `@frompackage` can be re-executed to reload the most recent version of
the module, allowing to work within Pluto with a workflow similar to Revise,
with the added advantage that some of the limitations of Revise requiring to
restart the Julia session (like redefining structs) are avoided.

The main purpose of this is to be able to create packages starting from Pluto
notebooks as building blocks. While this approach to Package development has its
disadvantages, it can be very convenient to speed up the workflow especially at
the beginning of development thanks to avoiding the need to restart Julia when
redefining structs, and exploiting the reactivity of Pluto to quickly assess
*automagically* that your code update did indeed fix the issues by just having
some cells that depend on your changed functions in a notebook.

While the points mentioned above are achievable within a single pluto notebook
without requiring to use this macro, when notebooks become quite complex,
containing many cells, they start to become quite sluggish or unresponsive, so
it is quite conveniente to be able to split the code into various notebook and
be able to access the functionality defined in other notebooks from a single
cell within a new notebook.

To simply import other notebooks, `@ingredients` from
[PlutoHooks](https://github.com/JuliaPluto/PlutoLinks.jl) or `@plutoinclude`
(which is inspired from `@ingredients`) from this PlutoDevMacros already exist,
but I found that they do have some limitations for what concerns directly using
notebooks as building blocks for a package.

# Arguments
Here are more details on the two arguments expected by the macro

## `target`

`target` has to be a String containing the path (either absolute or relative to
the file calling the macro) that points to a local Package (the path can be to
any file or subfolder within the Package folder) or to a specific file that is
*included* in the Package (so the `target` file appears within the Package
module definition inside an `include` call).  - When `target` is not pointing
directly to a file included in the Package, the full code of the module defining
the Package will be parsed and loaded in the Pluto workspace of the notebook
calling the macro.  - When `target` is actually a file included inside the
Package. The macro will just parse the Package module code up to and excluding
the inclusion of `target` and discard the rest of the code, thus loading inside
Pluto just a reduced part of the package. This is mimicking the behavior of
`include` within a package, such that each `included` file only has visibility
on the code that was loaded _before_ its inclusion. This behavior is also
essential when using this macro from a notebook that is also included in the
target Package, to avoid problems with variable redefinitions within the Pluto
notebook (this is also the original usecase of the macro).

## `import_block` 

The second argument to the macro is supposed to be either a single using/import
statement, or multiple using/import statements wrapped inside a `begin...end`
block.

These statements are used to conveniently select which of the loaded Package
names have te be imported within the notebook.  Most of these import statements
are only relevant when called within Pluto, so `@frompackage` simply avoid
loading the target Package and deletes these import statements **in most cases**
when called oustide of Pluto. There is a specific type of import statement
(relative import) that is relevant and applicable also outside of Pluto, so this
kind of statement is maintained in the macro output even outside of Pluto.

The macro respects the differentiation between `using` and `import` as in normal
Julia, so statements containing `using Module` without any variable name
specifier will import all the exported names of `Module`.

All supported statements also allow the following (catch-all) notation `import
Module: *`, which imports within the notebook all the variables that are created
or imported within `Module`. This is useful when one wants to avoid having
either export everything from the module file directly, or specify all the names
of the module when importing it into the notebook.

**Each import statement can only contain one module**, so statements like
*`import Module1, Module2` are not supported. In case multiple imports are
*needed, use multiple statements within a `begin...end` block.

Here are the kind of import statements that are supported by the macro:

### Relative Imports
Relative imports are the ones where the module name starts with a dot (.). These
are mostly relevant when the loaded module contains multiple submodules and they
are **the only supported statement that is kept also outside of Pluto**.

While _catch-all_ notation is supported also with relative imports (e.g. `import
..SiblingModule: *`), the extraction of all the names from the desired relative
module requires loading and inspecting the full Package module and is thus only
functional inside of Pluto. **This kind of statement is deleted when
@frompackage is called outside of Pluto**.

### `FromPackage` imports
These are all the import statements that have the name `FromPackage` as the
first identifier, e.g.: - `using FromPackage.SubModule` - `import FromPackage:
varname` - `import FromPackage.SubModule.SubSubModule: *` These statements are
processed by the macro and transformed so that `FromPackage` actually points to
the module that was loaded by the macro.

### `FromParent` imports
These statements are similar to `FromPackage` ones, with two main difference:
- They only work if the `target` file is actually a file that is included in the
loaded Package, giving an error otherwise
- `FromParent` does not point to the loaded Package, but the module that
contains the line that calls `include(target)`. If `target`  is loaded from the
Package main module, and not from one of its submodules, then `FromParent` wil
point to the same module as `FromPackage`.

### Catch-All
The last supported statement is `import *`, which is equivalent to `import
FromParent: *`. 

This tries to reproduce within the namespace of the calling notebook, the
namespace that would be visible by the notebook file when it is loaded as part
of the Package module outside of Pluto.


## Reload Button
The macro, when called within Pluto, also creates a convenient button that can
be used to re-execute the cell calling the macro to reloade the Package code due
to a change. It can also be used to quickly navigate to the position of the cell
containing the macro by using Ctrl+Click. The reload button will change
appearance (getting a red border) when the macrocall encountered an error either
due to incorrect import statement (like if a `FromParent` import is used without
a proper target) or due to an error encountered when loading the package code.

To show a simple example of the macro and of the reload button, consider a
package that has the following definition (reduced from PlutoDevMacros tests):
```julia
module TestPackage

export toplevel_variable

toplevel_variable = 15
hidden_toplevel_variable = 10

module SpecificImport
    include("specific_imports1.jl")
    include("specific_imports2.jl")
end
end
```
The current video show a recording where "specific_imports1.jl" is opened as a
notebook on the left window, and "specific_imports2.jl" is opened on the right
one.

macro frompackage(target::String, ex)
	calling_file = String(__source__.file)
	out = _combined(ex, target, calling_file, __module__; macroname = "@frompackage")
	esc(out)
end

"""
The `@fromparent` macro only accepts the `import_block` as single argument, and
it uses the calling file as the target, so:
```julia
(@fromparent import_block) == (@frompackage @__FILE__ import_block)
```
Refer to the [`@frompackage`](@ref) documentation for understanding its use.

	calling_file = String(__source__.file)
	out = _combined(ex, calling_file, calling_file, __module__; macroname = "@fromparent")
